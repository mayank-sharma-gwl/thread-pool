This is a most stable version of a Thread Pool but with minimal features. 
Dev branch has new features and more optimisations (alongwith bugs ðŸ¥²). I am trying to make it stable and make it suitable for high performance applications.
Contributors are most welcome to make PR.

Star and keep wayching this repo for lates updates. Will be releasing the stable version sooner.

Bye Bye cuties!
